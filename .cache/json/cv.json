I am also a highly self-motivated and outgoing person that enjoys and endeavors to complete every task to a high standard. \n\nI am currently in secondary school and I am planning to go to 6th form and then on to university or an apprenticeship degree so I am looking for a job for the weekends or the evenings. I am looking for any job without a qualification requirement. I am good at working with others, adults and kids of all ethnicities and backgrounds and I can execute most complex instructions to a good standard.  \n\nI haven’t yet completed my GCSEs however of the 11 that I am doing I am predicted to get:  \n\nEnglish language (7), English literature (7), Math (9), Biology (7), Chemistry (8), Physics (6), Spanish (7), Computer science (7), Economics (7), History (8), and I have already completed my RS GCSE in which I got a () \n\nAlso, I have completed work experience in multiple different areas of work: \n\nJuly-August 2018           E2X      - I did a four week work experience course in the e-commerce company E2X where I learned lots of valuable skills such as working well with others and all sorts of computer skills.

One of my hobbies is rowing; I train for rowing every day from Monday to Saturday and I went to the London Youth Games 2018 where I placed 2nd in the individual race for my age group for indoor rowing. I also play other sports like football and basketball but I don’t play seriously.  \n\nReferences are available on request, \n\nThank you "}},"pathContext":{}}
