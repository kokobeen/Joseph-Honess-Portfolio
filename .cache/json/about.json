My name is Joseph Honess and I am a secondary school student at Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, London. I grew up with my mum and my sister. I also have many cats who are getting old; they are quite tranquil although sometimes annoying when they seek attention.","para2":"I enjoy coding and gaming and aspire to become an accomplished web and game developer. I plan on going on to 6th form before starting a degree apprenticeship in a company that involves software development. ","para3":"My hobbies involve gaming, coding, watching anime and rowing. While i am passionate about all of these, rowing takes up an especially large amount of my time as I train multiple times every day from Monday to Saturday. I enjoy rowing as it is more sociable than my other hobbies although I enjoy playing team video-games while talking to my friends. I also like it because of the fitness aspect, rowing keeps me fit even when I sit in my chair for the rest of my free time. ","para4":"I listen to music all the time and although I listen to all sorts of music my favorite is hip-hop and rap. My favorite rapper is NF but I also really like Hopsin, I think that both of them rap about life and they have very good lyrics although Hopsin is quite aggressive and rude. ","para5":"I do not like nuts, beans or spiders but other than that i am not fussy. I love meat. I would eat almost any meat but i also really enjoy Italian food like spaghetti."}},"pathContext":{}}
